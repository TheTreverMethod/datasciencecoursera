# Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project - Code Book

### This is the Code Book for the final project. The document contains two sections. The first, is a code book describing how the data was produced, and the variables in the resulting data. The second, is the study design copied from the original data set.

## Code Book
### This section contains information about the data sets in this repository.

The tidy data sets produced for this project are `measurements-tidy.csv` and `measurementsAvg-tidy.csv`. The first contains the mean and standard deviation for each measurement for a single recording. The second contains the mean of each of these measurements for each subject and activity.

The variables for each data set are as follows:

1. subjects - The subject identifier
1. activities - The activity being performed

   The names of the fields below were taken from the features.txt file from the original data. There are explanations for each in the `features_info.txt` file in this repository, which was copied from the original data set.

#### At a high level, the following steps were taken to produce the tidy data sets:

1. Merge the test and train data sets for the subjects, activities, and measurements data.
1. Assign variable names to the measurements data using the features.txt file from the original data.
1. Remove duplicate columns, this step was needed to perform the next step.
1. Select from the measurements data only the mean and standard deviation measurements.
1. Merge the subjects, activities and measurements data sets.
1. Sort by the subject identifier.
1. Write this data frame to a file - this is the first set.
1. Create another data set that groups the first by subject and activity.
1. Use `summarize_all` to apply the mean function to all other columns.
1. Write the resulting data frame to a file - this is the second set.

## Study Design
### This section contains information from the original study and original data, from which the tidy data sets were created. It was copied from the README for the original data set.


Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0
======================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
